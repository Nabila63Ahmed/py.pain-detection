# py.pain-detection

The pain detection system is responsible for taking input from a heart rate monitor, a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor and (a) frame(s) of the user’s face. By capturing this data, the system is able to detect the existence of pain and the level thereof. Initially, the system is trained using deep learning with a expressions - emotions dataset as well as pain levels dataset. Subsequently, it would be able to then classify the facial expressions in a given test/user image with high accuracy. The system will also be familiar with the computation and relevance of the inputs from the heart rate monitor and the GSR, and will be able to integrate this data to produce a more accurate prediction of the user’s state.
